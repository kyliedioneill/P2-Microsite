                <h2>Inspiration</h2> The inspiration of merge comes from the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. Pulse, a gay nightclub, was targeted as an act of terrorism and hate. 49 people were killed.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Mapping</h2> From the event, I came up with multiple consequences and then reactions to them, following the direct aftermath of the shooting.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2> The conclusion was that as a direct result of the attack, LGBTQ people will be increasingly apprehensive to leave their homes and go to events.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Solution</h2> The solution is to then create an app for LGBTQ people, for them to connect by locating events within a radius that they can feel safe and have fun at. </div>

        <div class="explanation-2">
            <div>
                <h2>Final Result</h2> The final app created was named merge, for the reasoning that the people in the LGBTQ community are merging together and celebrating their lifestyles. </div>

        Merge opens to a map. Draw to set your own customized radius, then press the next arrow. Zoom or pan to see more of the map. Events are then found and can be clicked on, pulling up an information page with the added options to view photos or buy a ticket.</div>
